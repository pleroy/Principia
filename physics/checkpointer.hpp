// The checkpointer helps with compact serialization of timelines, i.e., classes
// that associate some data with distinct instants.  The naïve implementation of
// serialization for timelines would write all the pairs (time, data) but that
// would potentially result in large saves that would be expensive to read and
// write.
// Instead, this class creates checkpoints that encapsulate all information
// needed to reconstruct the timeline after a give point in time.  When
// serializing a timeline, the pairs (time, data) are written up to the oldest
// checkpoint, followed by the checkpoints themselves.  When deserializing, the
// timeline may be reconstructed as needed based on the checkpoints.
// Checkpoints must be created at regular intervals to ensure that the timeline
// may be reconstructed fast enough.
// The |Message| must declare a nested message named |Checkpoint|, which must
// have a field named |time| of type |Point|.  There must be a repeated field of
// |Checkpoint|s in |Message|.
// This class is thread-safe.  The callbacks are not run under a lock.
