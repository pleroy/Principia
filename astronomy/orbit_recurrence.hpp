// All references in this class are to [Cap12]; the notation follows that of the
// book.
//
// The ground track of a satellite recurs when, in a reference frame fixing the
// plane of the orbit and the equator of the Earth (such a reference frame is
// possible under the assumption that the orbital plane precesses around the
// equator), the following two conditions occur simultaneously:
// — the satellite has gone through an integer number of revolutions Nᴛₒ;
// — the primary has gone through an integer number of revolutions Cᴛₒ.
// Such a recurrence is characterized by the value Nᴛₒ / Cᴛₒ.
// This class represents that rational number; while it exposes many quantities
// that are relevant to mission design, they are all derived from it.
//
// In this class, the word “day” is used to denote a revolution of the primary
// in the reference frame fixing the orbital plane.  Note that this day depends
// on the nodal precession of the satellite: it is not any of the usual
// definitions of the day:
// — for a sun-synchronous orbit (see sections 7.5.4, 7.5.5), this day is the
//   mean solar day;
// — for an orbit with no nodal precession (i.e., a strictly polar orbit, see
//   section 7.1.3), this day is the stellar day.
// These days are counted negatively for a body with retrograde rotation.
